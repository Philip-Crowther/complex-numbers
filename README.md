# complex-numbers
This code defines a ComplexNumber class that represents a complex number in Python. The class contains methods to create complex numbers from a string representation, an angle and a magnitude representation, and to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has properties to get the angle and magnitude of a complex number, as well as a method to return the absolute value of the complex number.


The __init__ method is the constructor of the ComplexNumber class, which takes two arguments real and imaginary. If these arguments are not provided, they default to zero.

The from_str method is a class method that creates a ComplexNumber instance from a string representation of a complex number.

The from_angle method is another class method that creates a ComplexNumber instance from an angle and a magnitude representation of a complex number.

The angle and magnitude methods are properties that return the angle and magnitude of a ComplexNumber instance, respectively.

The __repr__ and __str__ methods return string representations of a ComplexNumber instance.

The __add__, __sub__, __mul__, and __truediv__ methods implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers, respectively.

The __abs__ method returns the absolute value of a complex number, which is the magnitude.
